# News
**[2025.1]** To enhance readability, we restructured the IMAX code based on [Troika](https://github.com/bighuang624/Troika?tab=readme-ov-file) and introduced an Adapter module to facilitate the adaptation of the CLIP visual encoder to the test dataset. 

**[2025.1]** We have completed the open-sourcing of the CLIP-based IMAX code, and the remaining encoder implementations will be uploaded shortly.
